# Space-Travels

This is my first attempt at designing a game. So, it's a simple game where the asteroid traveling through space is trying to dodge asteroids that are coming at it. I wanted to make this game more interesting by changing the input style. I added hand detection to the game to let the player use his/her hands to control the spaceship. This is a work-in-progress, as there are many other features that I would like to add along with performance improvements. However, below is a picture that shows the current game.
